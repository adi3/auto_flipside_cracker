# Auto Flipside Cracker

An extension for Google Chrome that probes The Stanford Flipside (TSF) website for its latest weekly challenge, solves its puzzles and submits the answers. All automatically!

Builds upon my previous extension [Flipside Cracker](https://github.com/adi3/flipside_cracker).

## Notes

{Add instructions here}

+ You can't win more than one shotglass through TSF's challenge, but it's fun to top scoreboards anyway.

+ If you're part of TSF and want to fix the security vunerability which enables this extension to work, contact me.
