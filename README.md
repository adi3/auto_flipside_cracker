# Auto Flipside Cracker

An extension for Google Chrome that probes The Stanford Flipside (TSF) website for its latest weekly challenge, solves its puzzles and submits the answers. All automatically!

Builds upon my previous extension [Flipside Cracker](https://github.com/adi3/flipside_cracker).

## Notes

+ Simply install the extension in your Chrome browser, and you're good to go! The extension will check TSF's website **once per day** for new challenges and solves them if found. All operations carried out in a background tab that remains open for ~12 seconds before closing.

+ Make sure you're logged into your Facebook account so TSF's site registers the answers under your name. If you're not logged in, your entry will not go on TSF's leaderboard.

+ You can't win more than one shot glass through TSF's challenge, but it's fun to top leaderboards anyway :)

+ If you're part of TSF and want to fix the security vulnerability which enables this extension to work, contact me.
